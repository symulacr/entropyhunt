## What This Is

The target system is a 5-drone search coordination system where the swarm's collective next action is always: send the next available drone to the zone of highest joint uncertainty — maximum information entropy. No pre-assigned grid sectors. No central planner. No ROS master node. The search pattern is not programmed; it emerges from the swarm's shared certainty state.

The coordination problem is genuine: when two drones simultaneously lock onto the same high-entropy zone, they must P2P-auction the zone boundary using BFT consensus. The auction output determines which drone takes which sub-zone. Remove Vertex and the auction has no Byzantine-resistant arbitration. Remove FoxMQ and the shared certainty map does not exist.

**Minimum demo requirement:** 5 simulated drones, Webots or equivalent. Mocked sensor data is explicitly permitted by the Track 2 brief. The focus is the mesh coordination logic, not the sensor accuracy.

## Current Repository Status

This repository currently contains a **working local prototype**, not the full live stack described in the handoff:

- runnable Python stub simulation: `main.py --mode stub` -> `simulation/stub.py`
- runnable local multi-process peer runtime: `main.py --mode peer` / `scripts/run_local_peers.py`
- certainty/entropy scoring, local UDP peer transport, heartbeat, and simplified BFT-style claim resolution
- ASCII CLI heatmap output and JSON summary/final-map output
- a packaged static app shell source (`frontend/index.template.html`) that builds into `dist/`
- two static HTML operator consoles: `entropy_hunt_v2.html` and `entropy_hunt_mockup.html`
- passing tests and static analysis in the current repo state

It does **not** yet contain the live Vertex/FoxMQ/Webots runtime, the production frontend app shell, or all of the optional files named later in the target file structure. Treat the rest of this document as the ambition and implementation plan for parity, not as a claim that the whole system already exists.

## Why This Is Not "Frontier Exploration With BFT Stickered On"

Frontier-based exploration (Yamauchi 1997) assigns each robot a "frontier" — the boundary between explored and unexplored space — using a centralised cost function. There is one map owner. There is one coordinator.

Entropy Hunt is different in three specific ways:

1. **Decentralised certainty fusion:** Each drone maintains its own local certainty map. These maps are P2P-merged via FoxMQ shared state. No drone is the authoritative map owner. If the drone with the "best" map goes offline, its state survives in the FoxMQ mesh.
2. **BFT-resistant zone auction:** When two drones target the same zone, the split is determined by a BFT round — not by a central scheduler, not by first-come-first-served (which is gameable). The auction outcome is verified by all peers.
3. **Certainty decay:** A zone searched 60 seconds ago becomes less certain over time (modelled as exponential decay). The swarm re-hunts stale certainty zones autonomously. This is not a feature of frontier exploration — it is inherent to the information-theoretic model.

---

## Core Mechanism

### The Certainty Map

A 2D grid of `N × N` cells (recommend 10×10 for demo — 100 cells, 5 drones, coverage ratio is clear). Each cell:

```python
@dataclass
class CellState:
    x: int
    y: int
    certainty: float      # 0.0 = completely unknown, 1.0 = fully searched
    last_updated_ms: int  # Unix timestamp ms
    updated_by: str       # peer_id of last drone to update
    decay_rate: float     # 0.001 per second — certainty decays toward 0.5 when stale
```

**Certainty update rule:** When drone D is in cell (x,y) for one simulation tick:
`cell.certainty = min(1.0, cell.certainty + 0.05)`

**Certainty decay rule (applied every second to all cells):**
`cell.certainty += decay_rate * (0.5 - cell.certainty)`
(Certainty decays toward 0.5 — maximum entropy — not toward 0. An old observation is uncertain, not unknown.)

### Information Entropy Per Cell

`H(cell) = -p * log2(p) - (1-p) * log2(1-p)`
where `p = cell.certainty`.

Maximum entropy is at `certainty = 0.5` (H = 1.0 bit). Fully searched (certainty = 1.0) and fully unknown (certainty = 0.0) are both zero entropy — the swarm is either certain it's empty or certain it's unsearched. The interesting zone is the uncertain middle.

**Greedy zone selection:** Each drone computes `argmax H(cell)` over all cells not currently claimed by another drone. This is each drone's independent estimate of where to go next. No communication needed for the selection itself — only for the claim lock.

### Zone Auction Protocol

This is the genuine coordination problem. Two drones independently compute the same max-entropy cell and send simultaneous CLAIM messages.

**Without BFT:** First-come-first-served. Gameable. Race condition on network latency. Not Byzantine-resistant.

**With BFT:**

1. Both Drone A and Drone B publish CLAIM for cell (3,7) to `swarm/zone_claims`
2. FoxMQ delivers both claims to all 5 peers
3. BFT round is triggered: all online drones vote on which claim is valid (timestamp precedence + drone proximity to cell as tiebreaker)
4. BFT output: Drone A gets (3,7), Drone B gets second-highest entropy cell
5. Both drones receive the confirmed assignment and begin transit

**Zone split (advanced):** If two drones are equidistant to the contested cell, BFT can split it: Drone A gets left half, Drone B gets right half. This is the emergent Voronoi partition behaviour — not programmed, produced by the auction.

## Drone State Machine

```
IDLE → COMPUTING (entropy argmax) → CLAIMING (BFT round)
                                         │
                              ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                         CLAIM_WON             CLAIM_LOST
                              │                     │
                          TRANSITING           COMPUTING (next)
                              │
                          SEARCHING (incrementing certainty)
                              │
                      ZONE_COMPLETE (certainty > 0.95)
                              │
                           IDLE
```

**Offline/stale state:** If a drone's heartbeat is absent for >3 seconds, all peers mark it `STALE`. Its claimed zone is released back to the claim pool. BFT round confirms the release. The released zone certainty is set to its current decay-computed value — no manual reset.

## Build Order (Execute in Sequence)

### Step 1 — Vertex handshake and heartbeat

Follow https://github.com/tashigit/vertex-hackathon-guide. Start 2 Python Vertex nodes. Exchange signed hello. Implement 1Hz heartbeat on `swarm/heartbeat/{id}`. Implement stale detection (no heartbeat for 3s → mark peer STALE). This is the Warm-Up track exercise — complete it first and submit to Discord for the daily bounty.

### Step 2 — FoxMQ certainty map

Implement `core/certainty_map.py`. Initialise a 10×10 grid (all certainty = 0.5 — maximum entropy at start, since nothing is known). Publish the full grid to `swarm/certainty_map` from Drone_1. Confirm Drone_2 receives it and can compute entropy values. Implement the decay function. Test: let grid sit idle for 30 seconds. Confirm all cells with certainty > 0.5 have decayed toward 0.5.

### Step 3 — Zone selector

Implement `core/zone_selector.py`. Input: current certainty map + set of claimed zones. Output: `(x, y)` of max entropy cell not currently claimed. Test with a partially-searched grid: confirm the selector always returns the least certain unclaimed cell. Edge case: all cells at maximum certainty (search complete) → return None, drone goes IDLE.

### Step 4 — BFT claim lock (no contention case first)

Implement claim publication to `swarm/zone_claims`. Implement BFT round where all peers acknowledge a claim with no competitor. Confirm all 5 drones agree that Drone_1 owns cell (3,7). This is the no-contention baseline.

### Step 5 — BFT claim lock (contention case)

Simultaneously submit two CLAIM messages for the same cell from Drone_1 and Drone_2. Trigger BFT round. BFT must produce exactly one winner. Implement tiebreaker: drone closest to the contested cell wins (use Euclidean distance from current drone position). If equidistant: implement zone split. Test determinism: run the same contention 10 times, confirm same winner each time given same positions.

### Step 6 — Webots integration (or stub)

If using Webots: implement `simulation/webots_bridge.py`. Use the Webots Supervisor API to read drone positions and send movement commands. The controller script runs inside Webots; it calls `searcher.py` to get the next zone and moves the drone there.

If not using Webots: implement `simulation/stub.py`. A grid where drone positions are integers, movement is teleport (one cell per tick), and "searching" means incrementing certainty for the current cell. This is sufficient for the coordination demo — the brief explicitly says "Use mocked sensor data."

### Step 7 — Live entropy heatmap

Implement `viz/heatmap.py` using `matplotlib.animation`. 10×10 grid, cell colour from white (certainty 1.0) to dark grey (certainty 0.5, maximum entropy) to black (certainty 0.0). Drone positions as coloured dots. Zone ownership boundaries as thin lines. This is your submission video visual.

### Step 8 — Failure injection

Implement `failure/injector.py`. After 60 seconds of running, call `os.kill(drone_2_pid, SIGKILL)` (or disconnect its Vertex node). All peers detect the absent heartbeat after 3 seconds and mark Drone_2 STALE. Drone_2's claimed zone is released via BFT round. A surviving drone claims it. The heatmap shows no interruption in coverage.

### Step 9 — Survivor simulation

Implement a "survivor found" event. When any drone reaches certainty > 0.95 in a designated target cell (pre-seeded), it publishes to `swarm/survivor_found` with coordinates and confidence. All other drones receive the event. The demo ends.

### Step 10 — Demo run

```bash
python main.py --drones 5 --grid 10 --duration 180 --target 7,3 --fail drone_2 --fail-at 60
```

Expected output: certainty map shows full coverage, survivor found event printed, failure injection and recovery logged, final certainty map saved to `final_map.json`.

## Synthetic Packet Loss Setup (For Robustness Criterion)

On Linux (required for Track 2 "severe network constraints" criterion):

```bash
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem loss 20% delay 100ms
```

Run your demo under this condition. Show that BFT rounds still complete (they will take longer but succeed). Remove after demo:

```bash
sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root
```

## Judge Attacks and Pre-Emptions

**"Frontier-based exploration is 30 years old."**
Your answer: "Entropy Hunt is not frontier exploration. Frontier exploration requires a central map owner and a global cost function. Entropy Hunt uses P2P-merged certainty maps with BFT-resistant zone auctions. The coordination mechanism — not the search heuristic — is the submission. Frontier exploration has no equivalent of the BFT claim lock or the emergent Voronoi zone partition."

**"Your 'entropy' is just inverse coverage percentage."**
Your answer: "Shannon entropy is not inverse coverage. At certainty = 0.0 or 1.0, H = 0. At certainty = 0.5, H = 1.0 bit. The decay function pushes searched zones toward 0.5 (maximum entropy), not toward 0.0. This means the swarm re-hunts stale zones — a behaviour not possible with coverage-percentage targeting." Show the decay function in your README.

**"Webots simulation with mocked sensors is not realistic."**
Your answer: Quote the Track 2 brief verbatim: "Use mocked sensor data if it helps you focus on the mesh networking." This is not a sensor demo. It is a coordination demo. The brief says this explicitly.

## Notes for Claude Code Agent

- Implement `core/certainty_map.py` first and test it in isolation before connecting to Vertex/FoxMQ. The entropy math is simple — do not overcomplicate it.
- The FoxMQ certainty map should transmit the full grid as JSON on every update. At 10×10 = 100 cells, this is ~4KB per message — acceptable. For 20×20, consider delta compression (only send changed cells).
- The BFT round for zone claims does not need to implement full pBFT. A simpler signed-vote majority is sufficient: each peer signs its vote, claims are validated by checking 3-of-5 (or N/2+1) signatures. The Tashi SDK likely provides a convenience wrapper — check the hackathon guide.
- Webots is optional. A pure Python grid simulation (`simulation/stub.py`) is faster to build and sufficient for the coordination demo. Only add Webots if time permits after the coordination logic is complete and stable.
- The `matplotlib` heatmap must update live without blocking the async event loop. Use `plt.pause(0.1)` in a separate thread or use `matplotlib` in non-interactive mode with file output if threading is problematic.
- The demo run must terminate cleanly and print a summary. Judges will run it. A demo that hangs or crashes on exit is a deduction.
- Target 10×10 grid, 5 drones, 180 second run. Full coverage is achievable in under 120 seconds. The remaining 60 seconds shows the decay and re-search behaviour.
- If Vertex SDK is not yet available as a Python package, use the C bindings via `ctypes` or run the Vertex node as a subprocess and communicate via stdin/stdout. The hackathon guide covers this.
- Search `tashi vertex python ctypes` if direct SDK is unavailable.

## Prototype Audit and Production Handoff

The two HTML files in this directory are **UI prototypes**, not the production implementation. They are useful for visual direction and demo scripting, but they currently simulate the swarm locally in inline JavaScript. Treat them as throwaway references unless a production pass extracts their logic into tested modules.

### Audited Files

### Current cleanup status (2026-04-04)

- The default Python demo is now tuned to the static-console constants (`search_increment=0.12`, `completion_certainty=0.92`) so the 10×10 / 180s run reaches full completed coverage while still showing decay on the live snapshot.
- `final_map.json` now carries replay-friendly metadata: config, events, Voronoi partitions, partition boundaries, and a dependency-free Webots bridge snapshot.
- Both HTML consoles can now load a real simulation replay payload via **Load replay** and clearly distinguish `synthetic demo` from `replay snapshot` mode.
- The repo now includes the missing spec-alignment modules: `failure/injector.py`, `auction/voronoi.py`, `simulation/webots_bridge.py`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`.
- A real local peer runtime now exists via `simulation/peer_runtime.py` + `scripts/run_local_peers.py`, so heartbeat/claim/BFT/survivor flows can run across separate local processes even though the transport is not yet Vertex/FoxMQ.
- A packaged frontend entrypoint now exists via `package.json` + `scripts/build_frontend.py`, producing a deployable static shell in `dist/`.
- `vercel.json` now wires Vercel to `npm run build` with `dist/` as the output directory, `docs/frontend-qa-checklist.md` documents the recommended manual browser QA pass, and `docs/vercel-deploy.md` documents first-time setup plus one-command preview/production deploys.

### Concrete Review Findings

1. **Prototype logic diverged from the written spec.**
   - The markdown describes deterministic BFT claim resolution using timestamp precedence and proximity. The prototypes were simulating auctions inline and, before cleanup, could report misleading round counts or random-looking outcomes.
   - Action: keep the UI copy aligned with the implementation contract. If the frontend is only a mockup, label synthetic behaviour explicitly.

2. **Standalone rendering needed local design-token fallbacks.**
   - Both HTML files referenced `var(--color-*)` and font tokens that only work when a parent shell injects Anthropic-style variables.
   - Action: provide local `:root` defaults in prototypes, then replace them with app-level design tokens when the production shell exists.

3. **Two demo-state bugs undermined operator trust.**
   - Reconnect/revive flows reused `y = x`, causing diagonal respawns that look like a bug instead of a simulation decision.
   - Canvas drawing used CSS custom-property strings directly in script, which is unreliable for `CanvasRenderingContext2D` colors.
   - Action: keep simulation helpers deterministic and resolve CSS tokens before using them in canvas drawing.

4. **The prototypes are still not production-grade frontend code.**
   - Inline event handlers (`onclick=...`), inline simulation logic, global mutable state, and no tests mean they are unsuitable as the deployed Vercel app.
   - Action: split the production app into:
     - `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` or equivalent landing surface
     - `components/entropy-console/*` for presentation
     - `lib/sim/*` for deterministic local demo logic
     - `lib/mesh/*` for real Vertex/FoxMQ integration
     - `lib/contracts/*` for shared swarm-state types

### Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Move entropy math, cell ownership, and auction selection into testable modules.
- [ ] Replace inline DOM mutation with framework state updates or a small view-model layer.
- [ ] Make BFT status labels honest: `synthetic`, `simulated`, or `live mesh`.
- [ ] Remove all hard-coded `10×10 = 100 cells` assumptions; derive totals from config.
- [x] Add a real deployment entrypoint (`package.json`, build command; static-shell `dist/` output).
- [ ] Add smoke tests for: coverage calculation, auction winner selection, revive/dropout handling, and survivor detection.
- [ ] Keep the markdown handoff in sync with whatever actually ships.

### Recommended Vercel Delivery Order

1. Keep the generated `dist/index.html` static shell as the landing/deployment surface.
2. Ship the replayable standalone consoles beside it (`dist/console.html`, `dist/mockup.html`) while clearly labelling them as prototype/demo surfaces.
3. Add a server/API boundary only when real swarm events exist to stream into the UI.
4. Do **not** claim live Vertex/FoxMQ support in the deployed UI until the data path is real and observable.
